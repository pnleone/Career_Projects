## **Summary**

This cybersecurity lab demonstrates production-ready security capabilities aligned with eight industry-standard frameworks, each validating specific aspects of SecOps, Systems Engineering, and Network Defense operations:

**Core Strengths:**

- **Operational Security Excellence:** 100% security event logging with dual SIEM, <5min MTTD, <30min MTTR via automated SOAR workflows
- **Technical Architecture Maturity:** Defense-in-depth across network/application/endpoint/identity layers with Infrastructure as Code automation
- **Framework Compliance:** Tier 3-4 NIST CSF, 93% CIS IG1, 77% ISO 27001, Advanced Zero Trust maturity across all pillars
- **Zero Trust Implementation:** Explicit verification, micro-segmentation, encrypted communications, continuous monitoring achieving Advanced (Stage 3/4) maturity
