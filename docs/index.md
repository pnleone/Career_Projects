# What I Do

- :material-shield-cog: **Security Engineering** — building detection pipelines, log ingestion workflows, and monitoring architectures.  
- :material-bullseye-arrow: **Threat‑Informed Defense** — mapping adversary behaviors to detections, controls, and SOC processes.  
- :material-database-search: **Data Analytics & Automation** — transforming raw data into dashboards, insights, and automated workflows.  
- :material-cloud-outline: **Cloud & Infrastructure** — designing secure, scalable environments for experimentation and learning.  
- :material-file-document-edit: **Technical Writing & Documentation** — creating clear, structured documentation for complex systems.
