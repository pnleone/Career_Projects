## About
**Paul Leone** | *Aspiring Security Analyst & Infrastructure Engineer*

Welcome to my professional portfolio. This site showcases my journey into cybersecurity, documenting the technical labs, security frameworks, and automation workflows I've built to defend modern infrastructure.

My focus is on bridging the gap between IT Operations (SysAdmin) and Security Operations (Blue Teaming). Through these projects, I demonstrate a commitment to continuous learning, a "secure-by-design" mindset, and the technical proficiency required to mitigate risks in enterprise environments.

## Featured Project: Security Homelab

!!! abstract "Enterprise-Grade Security Engineering Environment"
    **A fully segmented, detection-focused homelab** built to simulate real SOC workflows and enterprise infrastructure.

    **Key Capabilities:**
    
    - **Advanced Threat Detection** — Behavioral threat intelligence (CrowdSec), network anomaly detection (Suricata/Snort), and SIEM correlation (ELK Stack/Splunk)
    - **Automated Incident Response** — SOAR workflows integrate TheHive case management, Cortex/MISP enrichment, and automated remediation
    - **Defense-in-Depth Architecture** — Multi-layer controls spanning network perimeter, application layer, identity management, and endpoint protection
    - **Infrastructure as Code** — Terraform and Ansible enable version-controlled, repeatable deployments with full audit trails
    - **Full-Stack Observability** — Unified metrics collection (Prometheus), visualization (Grafana), and real-time alerting

    **Architecture Principles:**
    
    - **Defense in Depth** — Network segmentation, WAF protection, endpoint EDR, and identity verification create overlapping defensive barriers
    - **Secure by Design** — All services default to encrypted communications (TLS), authenticated access (SSO/MFA), and least-privilege authorization (RBAC)
    - **Zero Trust Architecture** — No implicit trust based on network location; continuous authentication and authorization for every request

## What I Do

**:material-shield-lock: Security Engineering**  
Building detection pipelines, log ingestion workflows, and monitoring architectures that provide actionable threat visibility across enterprise environments.

**:material-bullseye-arrow: Threat-Informed Defense**  
Mapping adversary behaviors to detections and controls using MITRE ATT&CK framework. Creating custom detection rules (YARA, Sigma) based on threat intelligence.

**:material-database-search: Data Analytics & Automation**  
Transforming raw security data into dashboards and insights. Automating repetitive tasks through Python, PowerShell, and workflow orchestration (n8n, Shuffle).

**:material-cloud-outline: Cloud & Infrastructure**  
Designing secure, scalable environments using virtualization (Proxmox, Docker), infrastructure as code (Terraform, Ansible), and high-availability architectures.

**:material-file-document-edit: Technical Writing & Documentation**  
Creating clear, structured documentation for complex systems. Translating technical implementations into business value for stakeholders.

**:material-chart-box-outline: Compliance & Frameworks**  
Aligning security controls to industry standards (NIST CSF 2.0, CIS Controls v8, ISO 27001, MITRE ATT&CK) with audit-ready documentation.
